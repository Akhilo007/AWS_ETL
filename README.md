# ETL Pipeline with AWS S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS services. The pipeline extracts data from a local system, transforms it using AWS Glue, and ingests the transformed data into AWS S3. The AWS Glue Data Catalog is used to create metadata tables, and AWS Athena is used to query the data. Finally, the data is visualized using AWS QuickSight.

## Architecture

1. **Data Source**:
   - Local files are used as the data source.
   - Data is directly uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - AWS Glue is used to transform the raw data into a structured format.
   - The transformed data is written back to S3.

3. **Data Crawling**:
   - AWS Glue Crawlers are configured to crawl the transformed data and update the Glue Data Catalog.

4. **Querying**:
   - AWS Athena queries the data stored in S3 using the Glue Data Catalog tables.

5. **Visualization**:
   - AWS QuickSight is used to create visualizations and dashboards for the data.

## Services Used

### **AWS S3**
- Acts as the primary storage for raw and transformed data.
- Data is uploaded directly from the local system to S3.

### **AWS Glue**
- Handles data transformation and schema evolution.
- Glue jobs are used to transform raw data into a structured format.

### **AWS Glue Crawler**
- Automatically crawls data in S3 and updates the Glue Data Catalog with metadata.

### **AWS Glue Data Catalog**
- Serves as a central metadata repository for Athena to query the data.

### **AWS Athena**
- Used to perform SQL-like queries on the data stored in S3.

### **AWS QuickSight**
- Used to create insightful dashboards and visualizations of the transformed data.

## Workflow

1. **Extract Data**:
   - Data is sourced from local files and uploaded to an S3 bucket.

2. **Transform Data**:
   - AWS Glue processes the raw data into a structured format.

3. **Load Data**:
   - The transformed data is stored in a different S3 location.

4. **Catalog Data**:
   - AWS Glue Crawler scans the transformed data and updates the Glue Data Catalog.

5. **Query Data**:
   - AWS Athena is used to run SQL queries on the Glue tables linked to S3.

6. **Visualize Data**:
   - AWS QuickSight connects to Athena to visualize the data and generate dashboards.

## Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Upload Data to S3**
1. Create an S3 bucket (if not already created).
2. Upload local files to the designated S3 bucket.

### **Step 2: Configure AWS Glue**
1. Create an AWS Glue job to process and transform the data.
2. Define the transformation logic in PySpark or Python.
3. Save the transformed data back to a different S3 bucket or folder.

### **Step 3: Create AWS Glue Crawler**
1. Configure the crawler to scan the S3 bucket containing the transformed data.
2. Run the crawler to populate the Glue Data Catalog.

### **Step 4: Query Data with Athena**
1. Open the AWS Athena console.
2. Select the Glue Data Catalog database.
3. Run SQL queries to validate and analyze the data.

### **Step 5: Visualize Data with QuickSight**
1. Connect QuickSight to Athena.
2. Import the queried data into QuickSight.
3. Create charts, graphs, and dashboards to visualize the data.

## Results and Visualizations
The data processed through the pipeline is visualized in AWS QuickSight, showcasing insights such as:
- Trends over time
- Aggregations by category
- Custom dashboards for business needs

## Future Improvements
1. Automate the pipeline using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch for scheduling.
2. Integrate error handling and monitoring using AWS CloudWatch Logs.
3. Explore additional datasets and visualization techniques in QuickSight.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with necessary IAM permissions for S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight.
- Data files stored locally for initial upload.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and AWS services.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how AWS services can be integrated to build a scalable ETL pipeline.
The pipeline efficiently handles data extraction, transformation, and loading while enabling analytics and visualization.
